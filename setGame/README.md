Set Solver

The problem at hand is to write a solver for the game of Set. In case you're not familiar with the game, you can find a tutorial here:

Task 1: Each card has symbols on it that vary across four dimensions: color, number, shape, and shading. There are three possible values per dimension (e.g. there are three possible colors: red, green, and purple). Start by writing a solver that takes in a collection of these cards (e.g. 9 cards, 12 cards, 15 cards, etc.), and returns all possible sets that can be made from the inputs.

Task 2: Then, once you've solved the basic game, extend your solution to handle an arbitrary number of dimensions per card (e.g. each card now has a background color, with three possible values).

Task 3: Then, once you've got arbitrary dimensions, extend your solution to handle an arbitrary size for the dimensions (e.g. there are now four possible shapes, four colors, four of every dimension). You may assume the number of cards remains three, or solve for an arbitrary number greater than three for extra credit.

In your response, please send (or link to github, etc):

(1) Your solver, written in Java or Python (you only need to include the solution to Task 3, since it can be used to do Task 1 and 2, too)

(2) Instructions on how to run the code

(3) Any unit tests that you wrote to demonstrate the correctness of your solution
